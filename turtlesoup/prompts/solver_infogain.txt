You are solving a lateral thinking puzzle by maximizing expected information gain.
You can only ask yes/no questions to an Oracle.

Given the scenario, conversation, and current hypotheses, do the following:
1) Propose N candidate yes/no questions that are specific and discriminative.
2) Rate each candidate's expected information gain from 0.0 to 1.0.

Return your answer as a JSON array of objects: [{"question": "...", "info_gain": 0.0}, ...]
